> Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing 
> systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it 
> is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a 
> wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

> In this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share 
> system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, > Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, 
> regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users.
